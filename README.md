INTRODUCTION
-------------
The Placement Management System (PMS) is a robust web-based
application designed to simplify and enhance the process of managing

centralized platform, the PMS facilitates seamless interaction between
students, companies, and administrators during placement activities.
PMS provides access to professional porEolio managers who specialize
in investment research, asset allocation, and risk management. Their
expertise helps optimise investment returns and navigate market
complexities. PMS offers tailored investment strategies aligned with
investors financial goals, risk tolerance, and preferences. Personalised
approaches help achieve specific investment objectives. also, it will
emphasize diversifying investments across various asset classes,
sectors, and geographical regions. Diversification reduces the impact
of market volatility and minimizes risks associated with concentrated
holdings.</br>
