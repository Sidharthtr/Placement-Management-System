# Placement-Management-System

INTRODUCTION
-------------
The Placement Management System (PMS) is a robust web-based
application designed to simplify and enhance the process of managing
student placements within educational institutions. By providing a
centralized plaEorm, the PMS facilitates seamless interaction between
students, companies, and administrators during placement activities.
PMS provides access to professional porEolio managers who specialize
in investment research, asset allocation, and risk management. Their
expertise helps optimise investment returns and navigate market
complexities. PMS offers tailored investment strategies aligned with
investors financial goals, risk tolerance, and preferences. Personalised
approaches help achieve specific investment objectives. also, it will
emphasize diversifying investments across various asset classes,
sectors, and geographical regions. Diversification reduces the impact
of market volatility and minimizes risks associated with concentrated
holdings.</br>
PMS allows investors to benefit from professional guidance. Portfolio
managers expertise helps construct well-informed investment
porEolios. Constructing an optimal investment portfolio requires time,
knowledge, and risk assessment.</br>
Novice investors may struggle to gauge their risk profile and select
suitable investments. PMS constructs tailor-made porEolios based on
individual investment horizons, risk tolerance, and taxation needs.
So, in this project, we are planning to build a Placement Management
System (PMS), which will guide students, college authorities, and even
companies to manage the placement process. we are building a better
user interface using HTML, CSS, React JS Node JS and Express JS for the
server side else MySql for database management.</br>
The Placement Management System aims to enhance transparency,
reduce manual paperwork, and foster efficient communication between students and companies. It provides a solid foundation for
effective placement management.</br>
